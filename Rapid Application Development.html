<h3 class="heading"> What is Rapid Application Development? </h3>
<div class="text">Rapid application development (RAD) is a term originally used to describe a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1981.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">It is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. A prototype is a working model that is functionally equivalent to a component of the product.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text"> In RAD model the functional modules are developed in parallel as prototypes and are integrated to make the complete product for faster product delivery.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">Since there is no detailed preplanning, it makes it easier to incorporate the changes within the development process. RAD projects follow iterative and incremental model and have small teams comprising of developers, domain experts, customer representatives and other IT resources working progressively on their component or prototype.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">The most important aspect for this model to be successful is to make sure that the prototypes developed are reusable.</div>

<h3 class="heading">Uses of Rapid Application Development</h3>
<div class="text">This model should be used where:</div>
<ul class="minorlist">
<li>A system can be modularized to be delivered in incremental manner</li>
<li>There's high availability of designers for modeling</li>
<li>The budget permits use of automated code generating tools</li>
<li>Domain experts are available with relevant business knowledge</li>
<li>The requirements change during the course of the project and working prototypes are to be presented to customer in small iterations of 2-3 months</li>
</ul>
