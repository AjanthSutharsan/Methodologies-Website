<h2 class="heading"> Waterfall Model </h2>
<h3 class="heading"> What is the Watefall Model? </h3>
<div class="text">The Waterfall model originates from a paper written in 1970 by Dr Winston W. Royce. The model is sequential/linear; only when the phase has finished, can the next phase begin. It may be necessary to return to one or more previous stages. If so, then on returning all the intervening steps must be revisited.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text"> However, although the model is widely used, Royce was not advocating the use of the model but rather claimed that the model was 'risky and invites failure.'</div>

<h3 class="heading"> The 6 Main Stages of the Waterfall Model </h3>
<ol class="majorlist">
<li>Determining Requirements: This is where the system and software requirements are stated. Requirements can be documented from questionnaires, observations, and structured interviews. Acceptance tests are often paired with these requirements</li>
<li>Analysis: This is where the feasibility of the system is assessed, and the manner of assessment can be remembered by the acronym TELOS
<ul type=square class="minorlist">
<li>Technical - Is the technology available?</li>
<li>Economical - Is it economical?</li>
<li>Legal - Is it legal?</li>
<li>Operations - How effective will the project be in solving the problem?</li>
<li>Schedule - Can it be done in time?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design: The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture. System Design can include the use of a data dictionary, a data flow diagram, a flowchart, or a structure diagram</li>
<li>Coding: The system is created through programming</li>
<li>Testing: The system is tested to see if it fulfills the requirements of the client, and the manner of testing can be done through white box and black box testing or alpha and beta testing
<ul type=square class="minorlist">
<li>White Box Testing - A software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester</li>
<li>Black Box Testing - A software testing method in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is NOT known to the tester</li>
<li>Alpha Testing - Testing of an application when development is about to be complete. Minor design changes can still be made as a result of alpha testing.</li>
<li>Beta Testing - Testing of an application in which a sample of the intended audience tries the product out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintenance: This phase is required so that the software is kept usable in a changed or changing environment. Maintenance can include adaptive, corrective, and perfective maintenance
<ul type=square class="minorlist">
<li>Adaptive Maintenance - This type of maintenance often occurs as a result of external influences or strategic changes within the company. The system is being adapted to remain up to date.</li>
<li>Corrective Maintenance - Most systems have imperfections. The initial testing of the system should find many of them but more obscure errors may only be encountered as users interact with the system day after day, and so corrective maintenance is where these errors found by users are fixed.</li>
<li>Perfective Maintenance - The system has been in place and running fine for a while. However, over time, the end user will often find tweaks or minor improvements which could be made to improve the way the system works. These tweaks are not major enough to prompt a complete new system, so the maintenance team improve the system to suit. This is called 'perfective maintenance'</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Advantages and Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model</h3>
<table>
<caption align=bottom> Table showing the advantages and disadvantages of the waterfall model for software development </caption>
<tr>
<th>Advantages of Waterfall Model</th>
<th>Disadvantages of Waterfall Model</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This model is simple and easy to understand and use</td>
<td>Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was not well-thought out in the concept stage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model â€“ each phase has specific deliverables and a review process, which can help to strengthen client confidence</td>
<td>No working software is produced until late during the life cycle so if the testing shows that the system doesn't meet its requirements, it would mean a lot of money would be wasted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In this model phases are processed and completed one at a time. Phases do not overlap</td>
<td>High amounts of risk and uncertainty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Waterfall model works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood</td>
<td>Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Poor model for long and ongoing projects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Efficient code is not prioritised so the project may use up unncessary memory</td>
</tr>

<h3 class="heading">Uses of the Waterfall Model</h3>
<div class="text">This model should be used where:</div>
<ul class="majorlist">
<li>The requirements are very well known, clear and fixed</li>
<li>The product definition is stable</li>
<li>The technology is understood</li>
<li>There are no ambiguous requirements</li>
<li>Ample resources with required expertise are available freely</li>
<li>The project is short</li>
