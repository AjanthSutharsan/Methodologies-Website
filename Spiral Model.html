<h2 class="heading"> Spiral Model </h2>
<h3 class="heading"> What is the Spiral Model? </h3>
<div class="text">The Spiral Model was documented in a paper by Barry W. Boehm in 1988.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">It combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic, controlled aspects of the waterfall model.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">Spiral model is a combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. waterfall model with very high emphasis on risk analysis.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">It allows for incremental releases of the product, or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">Below is an image showing the Spiral Model<div>

<h3 class="heading">The Four Quadrants of the Spiral Model</h3>
<ol class="majorlist">
<li>First Quadrant: Determine objectives, alternatives and constraints</li>
<li>Second Quadrant: Evaluation Risk Analysis
<div class="extrainfo">Risk Analysis includes identifying, estimating, and monitoring technical feasibility and management risks, such as schedule slippage and cost overrun. If the analysis shows that the risks are too high, the project is stopped, but if they aren't, a prototype is created.</div>
</li>
<li>Third Quadrant: Construction
<div class="extrainfo">In this quadrant, the prototype is developed</div>
</li>
<li>Fourth Quadrant: Planning for the next phase is done</li>
</ol>

<tr>
<th>Advantages of Spiral Model</th>
<th>Disadvantages of Spiral Model</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changing requirements can be accommodated</td>
<td>Management is more complex</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Allows for extensive use of prototypes</td>
<td>End of project may not be known early</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Requirements can be captured more accurately</td>
<td>Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Users see the system early</td>
<td>Process is complex</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Development can be divided into smaller parts and more risky parts can be developed earlier which helps better risk management</td>
<td>Spiral may go indefinitely</td>

<h3 class="heading">Uses of Spiral Model</h3>
<div>This model should be used where:</div>
<ul class="minorlist">
<li>There is a budget constraint and risk evaluation is important</li>
<li>The project is medium to high risk</li>
<li>There is long-term project commitment because of potential changes to economic priorities as the requirements change with time</li>
<li>The customer is not sure of their requirements which is usually the case</li>
<li>Requirements are complex and need evaluation to get clarity</li>
<li>There's a new product line which should be released in phases to get enough customer feedback</li>
<li>Significant changes are expected in the product during the development cycle</li>
</ul>
