<h3 class="heading"> What are the Agile Methods? </h3>
<div class="text">In response to the problems of the waterfall model, in 2001 a group of software engineers go together to discuss the growing field of what used to be called lightweight methods. They decided to use the term agile and wrote the Manifesto for Agile Software Development</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">The Agile model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations. Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks. Every iteration involves cross functional teams working simultaneously on various areas like planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing.</div>
<p></p>
<div class="text">At the end of the iteration a working product is displayed to the customer and important stakeholders.</div>
<p></p>
<h3 class="heading">The Main Principles of the Agile Manifesto</h3>
<div class="text">The following are the main principles:</div>
<ol class="majorlist">
<li>Individuals and interactions
<div class="extrainfo">In agile development, self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming</div>
</li>
<li>Working software
<div class="extrainfo">Demo working software is considered the best means of communication with the customer to understand their requirement, instead of just depending on documentation</div>
</li>
<li>Customer collaboration
<div class="extrainfo">As the requirements cannot be gathered completely in the beginning of the project due to various factors, continuous customer interaction is very important to get proper product requirements</div>
</li>
<li>Responding to change
<div class="extrainfo">Agile development is focused on quick responses to change and continuous development</div>
</li>
</ol>

<tr>
<th>Advantages of Agile Methods</th>
<th>Disadvantages of Agile Methods</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is a very realistic approach to software development</td>
<td>Not suitable for handling complex dependencies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Promotes teamwork and cross training</td>
<td>More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated</td>
<td>An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must without which it will not work</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Resource requirements are minimum</td>
<td>Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Suitable for fixed or changing requirements</td>
<td>Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delivers early partial working solutions</td>
<td>There is very high individual dependency, since there is minimum documentation generated</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good model for environments that change steadily</td>
<td>Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Minimal rules, documentation easily employed</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context</td>
<td></td>
