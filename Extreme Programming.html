<h3 class="heading">What is Extreme Programming?</h3>
<div class="text">Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology, which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.</div>

<h3 class="heading">Main Principles of Extreme Programming(XP)</h3>
<div class="text">The following are the main principles:</div>
<ol class="majorlist">
<li>Small releases</li>
<li>Project is divided into iterations</li>
<li>Stand up meeting starts each day</li>
<li>Refactor whenever and wherever possible</li>
<li>Customer is always available</li>
<li>All production code is pair programmed</li>
<li>Integrate often</li>
<li>All code must have unit tests</li>
</ol>

<caption align=bottom> Table showing the advantages and disadvantages of Extreme Programming for software development </caption>
<tr>
<th>Advantages of Extreme Programming(XP)</th>
<th>Disadvantages of Extreme Programming(XP)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reduced costs as developers focus on coding instead of needless paperwork and meetings. Feature based approach also ease the cost estimation as well. </td>
<td>Requires a detailed planning from the start due to changing costs & scope</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Using module structure, and pair programing XP spreads the risk and mitigate the dependence on individuals</td>
<td>Doesn't measure/plan Quality Assurance of coding</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Due to its simplicity, XP manages to create faster software with less defects. Test driven development at the coding stage and the customer UAT validation leads to successful development completion</td>
<td>Pair programming which might lead to too much duplication of codes and data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Changing requirements are accomodated</td>
<td>Requires more discipline in the team and devotion of your customers.  Project management might experience difficulties related with the  practice that changes  during the life cycle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Efficient code is prioritised</td>
